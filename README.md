# Nixie-Clock-powered-by-Arduino-Board
It will be (I hope) complete and working code for my nixie and arduino based clock.

1. Get time and date from DS3231 (Later we will try to read the time from DCF77). (temporarily used rinky dink electronics library)
To do list:
2. Get use from 74hc595 (shift registers), we will need it to expand our pinouts (we need 4 pins for each K155ID1 (nixie driver), and we will have 6 of them).
3. Get use of times functions and send time data to nixie drivers.
4. Get data from DCF77 some day.
